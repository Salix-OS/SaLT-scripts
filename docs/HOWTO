What packages are needed ?
At least:
 - fake-uname (optionnal but usefull)
 - kernelsource (exploded in a directory, linked from /usr/src/ ; or installed)
 - kernelive (not installed)
 - squashfs-tools
 - curlftpfs, sshfs(-fuse)
What needs to be installed to compile:
 - spkg or pkgtools or spkg-pkgtools
 - coreutils, sed, grep, tar, gzip, bzip2, xz, findutils
 - glibc, sysfsutils, gcc, glib2, automake, autoconf, make
 - wget
 - fuse, util-linux-ng
 - squashfs-tools
 - grub2
 - cdrtools
How to build a Live CD (here SalixLive)?
Steps :
1/ Create kernelive package.
  1/ Get the kernelsource of the kernel you want to build.
  2/ Use a tiny script fake-uname (available on this site as a package) to fake the kernel version in use.
  3/ Create a config-KVER.live for the corresponding KVER kernel version. You could have a look to the patch file to know the diff from slackware kernel in order to apply to yours.
  4/ use the kernelive SLKBUILD file with slkbuild.
2/ Install the squashfs-tools package.
3/ Create the PKGS directory and download there all packages that you want to put on the Live using getpkgs.sh script.
4/ Create a file per module you need which contains one package name per line.
5/ Create a file MODULES_INFO with the reference modules:
  module=kernel,packages-kernel
  module=base,packages-base
  module=live,packages-live
Where packages-* reference each file per module created in 4/. You can organize it anyway you want.
You must add at least the following packages:
  - kernelive
  - aaa_base, devs, sysvinit, ...
  - ash
  - all GNU basic packages
6/ copy standard kernel packages in std-kernel directory (huge, module & firmware).
7/ update the libraries in ./libs/ARCH with GNU ones if you want fresher ones. They will be use by initrd.
8/ run build-salixlive.sh (and wait) to output you an ISO file ready to burn or to be put on an USB key (not with Unetbootin, but with install-on-USB).

Good luck ^_^

P.S. liveenv directory is used to create a special package for special modifications for the live environment.
